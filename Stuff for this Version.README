when you start the quiz again, it doesn't start fro ma sunny state again
[10:42:49 PM] Tiphanie Lau: it just continues on from the result you got
[10:42:57 PM] Tiphanie Lau: the icons on top are huuuge
[10:43:17 PM] Tiphanie Lau: I think we should change questions/answers again, but we can do that tomorrow or something
[10:43:27 PM] Tiphanie Lau: and the transitions aren't worked out yet
[10:43:48 PM] Tiphanie Lau: I tried the display: none thing you were talking about, but it wasn't working right. I think I just couldn't target the class or id?
so I did something else, but the morphing ended up being super weird
and I'm going to restyle the next/begin button because it looks too similar to the options
